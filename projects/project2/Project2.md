:checkered_flag: Submit to Canvas a single .pdf file named Your_Last_Name_First_Name_Project2.pdf. This single pdf will contain your responses to the questions marked with a checkered flag. It is important that you ***clearly label*** each answer with the project part number and that you provide your name and email address at the top of the .pdf.

Many IoT applications monitor real time data from sensors and
transmit these data to a service offering publish and subscribe capabilities. The service behaves as a broker. The sensor plays the role of publisher and it may have no idea who its subscribers are. It simply transmits data to the broker. A subscriber subscribes to messages from the broker and, in this way, is able to consume data from the sensors.

The publish subscribe approach exemplifies loose coupling, provides for scalability, and is well established in the internet of things.

### Objectives

One objective of this project is to learn to use an MQTT publish and subscribe broker. There are many implementations of MQTT. We will use a broker named Mosquitto.

MQTT is targeted at low power, constrained, unreliable devices. It will likely play an important role in a mature IoT. In class, we will describe how MQTT works and how many of the big players are leveraging MQTT.

The second objective is to learn the Google Charts Javascript library. The internet of things will rely heavily on real time visualizations in the browser. Google Charts will likely play a significant role in this area.

The third objective is to continue our work with the Particle Argon microcontroller.

There will be some challenges along the way.


### Overview and setup


This is a five part assignment. The first part involves setting up an MQTT broker and interacting with the broker using browsers and WebSockets. The web applications will be built with Node.js.

The second part requires that you set up the appropriate hardware and program your Argon with firmware written in C++. The C++ code is provided but worth studying.

The third part involves the construction of a Node-RED flow that receives messages from the Argon via HTTP, makes modifications to the messages, and publishes the messages to MQTT. Note that we are not routing our messages through the Particle Cloud - as we did in Project 1.

The fourth part involves writing a web application that provides browser code that subscribes to the Argon's messages from MQTT and produces a textual display.

Part 5 is the same as Part 4 but includes Google Charts for visualization.

In Project 1, we monitored Argon heartbeats in real time with a browser. We leveraged WebSockets and wrote our own server side code that sent a message to all listeners.

In much of this project, we will not write our own server side code (as we did in Project 1). Instead, we will use Mosquitto - an open source MQTT broker. [Download Mosquitto from here.](http://mosquitto.org/download/)

Note: In the past, some students had trouble with Mosquitto but had an easy time downloading Hive MQ's MQTT broker. The instructions below refer to my success in using Mosquito. Feel free to use whatever MQTT broker that you are comfortable with. You may use the local Hive MQ (downloaded to your machine
or the remote version on the cloud.) Hive MQ's MQTT (both local and cloud) are available [from here](https://www.hivemq.com/try-out/).

You can install Mosquitto on your MAC using brew. See [here](http://brew.sh) and then use "brew install mosquitto". There are directions on the mosquitto web site for Windows users.

When you run mosquitto, it will run with its default configuration. We need to change its configuration to allow for WebSocket connections (we want to visit the server from
Javascript). To change the configuration of Mosquitto, we can modify the configuration file found at /usr/local/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf (on a MAC). My configuration file contains these lines at the very end of the file:

```
listener 1883
protocol mqtt
listener 9002
protocol websockets
allow_anonymous true

```

My copy of mosquitto is located at /opt/homebrew/sbin. If I change to that directory, I can run mosquitto (picking up the configuration file) with the command

```
mosquitto -c /opt/homebrew/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf -v

```

Once you have Mosquitto running, we want to connect to the server from Javascript running in a browser. We do not want to write the client side MQTT code ourselves. Even though we have
easy access to WebSockets, it would be far better to use an existing Javascript library
that provides a convenient API to MQTT. The implementation of the API will, of course,
use WebSockets below the scenes.

In our web pages, we will include the Javascript library from Paho. It is called mqttws31.js.

To make use of the mqttws31.js library, there is a very nice "getting started" section at the following link. It has a simple example of a Javascript client that will run in a web page. It is very useful for us and is found [here.](https://eclipse.org/paho/clients/js/)

I am including a copy of this client side Javascript here. Be sure to study how this works. You will need to incorporate it into your browser when you want your browser to communicate with an MQTT broker. Notice that it makes use of the Paho.MQTT library.

```
// Create a client instance
client = new Paho.MQTT.Client(location.hostname, Number(location.port), "clientId");

// set callback handlers
client.onConnectionLost = onConnectionLost;
client.onMessageArrived = onMessageArrived;

// connect the client
client.connect({onSuccess:onConnect});


// called when the client connects
function onConnect() {
  // Once a connection has been made, make a subscription and send a message.
  console.log("onConnect");
  client.subscribe("World");
  message = new Paho.MQTT.Message("Hello");
  message.destinationName = "World";
  client.send(message);
}

// called when the client loses its connection
function onConnectionLost(responseObject) {
  if (responseObject.errorCode !== 0) {
    console.log("onConnectionLost:"+responseObject.errorMessage);
  }
}

// called when a message arrives
function onMessageArrived(message) {
  console.log("onMessageArrived:"+message.payloadString);
}
```

The mqttws31.js file holds the Paho library and can be included in your HTML file with this script tag:

```
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/paho-mqtt/1.0.1/mqttws31.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

There is a nice discussion [here on MQTT.](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/iot-mqtt-why-good-for-iot/) It explains the publish subscribe patterns and shows an example using sensors.

### Part 1.

Your Part 1 we will experiment using real time data on the web.

1. 5 Points. Create an empty directory named Project2_Part1_Question_1.
Create a subdirectory named "public" and populate it with an index.html file. [This file contains the code found here.](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_onmousemove)
In the Project2_Part1_Question_1 directory, just above "public", create a file named index.js with the following code:

```
// index.js
// A directory named "public" is available in the current directory.
// The public directory holds index.html containing HTML and Javascript.
// A browser will visit with http://localhost:3000/index.html

const express = require('express')
const port = 3000
app = express();
// allow access to the files in public
app.use(express.static('public'));

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Mouse moving app listening at http://localhost:${port}/index.html`)
})
```
In the Project2_Part1_Question_1 directory, run the following three commands:

```
npm init               note: accept the defaults
npm install express
node index.js
```
You should be able to use a browser to visit http://localhost:3000/index.html.

It is important that you take some time to study the html and Javascript in the index.html file.  

Note that every time the mouse moves (within the box) an event is generated
and the x and y coordinates are displayed. It is required that you add your
own detailed comments to this code - explaining clearly how it works. The grader
will grade based on the quality of these comments.

:checkered_flag: Take a screenshot showing the browser screen.  Name your screenshot Project2Part1Question1.png.

:checkered_flag: Include your HTML and Javascript with comments.  Name your file Project2Part1Question1.html.

2. 15 Points. Here we want to sense the mouse movements and publish them to Mosquitto running MQTT. Create a new directory named Project2_Part1_Question_2. Include the same index.js file that you used in Part 1. Create a subdirectory named "public" containing an index.html file that publishes each new mouse coordinate pair to your MQTT broker. Your solution must make good use of the Javascript library - mqttws31.js.

3. 15 Points. Here we want to subscribe to the events being published in Part 1 Question 2. Create a new directory named Project2_Part1_Question_3.
Create subdirectories and files as you did in Question 2. This time, however, the web application will listen on port 3002 . In the index.js file, change the listening port from 3000 to 3002. This is so that we do not interfere with the server in Question 2 (listening on port 3000). The index.html file will make good use of mqttws31.js. It will subscribe to events published to Mosquitto and it will display the coordinates being received (there will be no box, just text being displayed). Test your system by running two browsers at the same time. One browser will display the box (from Question 2) and the other will display rapidly changing coordinates as the user of the other browser moves the mouse within the box.

In my solution, I included the following code before any Javascript code that makes use of it. This code is used to establish a connection to MQTT:

```
client = new Paho.MQTT.Client('localhost', Number(9002), "MouseTrackerSubscriber");
```


Note: MQTT is very fussy about client names. Each client that visits must present a unique name. In this part of Project 2, we need two names - one for the publisher and another for the subscriber. If you add several subscribers, you will need several names. The client shown just above has the name "MouseTrackerSubscriber".

Note too that the communication between the broker and the browsers is done with WebSockets but we have abstracted those details away. The details are all hidden within the mqttws31.js library. By using "abstraction" we are hiding details and separating concerns - these are very important principles in computer science and in many areas of engineering.

### Part 2 Monitoring light levels with a microcontroller

#### Hardware Set Up

We would like to configure our microcontroller to sense or monitor changes in light. Light monitoring has many applications from security to smart farming to home automation to industrial IoT.

1. Hold the Argon breadboard so that row 1 is away and row 30 is near (on the bottom).
2. Place the Argon bottom on row 26 of the breadboard.
3. The Argon top will now just cover row 7.
4. Be sure that you can read the writing on the Argon. It will be right side up.
5. Place the long leg of the photodiode in row 13, (A0) (on the left of the Argon).
6. Place the short leg of the photodiode in row 10 (3V3).
7. Place a 220 ohm resistor in row 12 (GND) and in row 13 (A0).
8. Your hardware setup should look like the following:
![Argon Light Monitor](https://github.com/mm6/InternetOfThingsCourse/blob/master/images/ArgonLightMonitor.png?raw=true)

9. We need to flash code that monitors light levels to the Argon. We will name this firmware "LightMonitor". Use the Particle cloud to compile and deploy this firmware to your microcontroller.

```
// File name: LightMonitor
// View output from the command line with
// particle serial monitor

int photodiode = A0;
int analogValue;

unsigned long loop_timer;

void setup() {
  Serial.println("Simple setup complete");
  loop_timer = millis();
}

void loop() {
    if(millis() - loop_timer >= 5000UL) {
        loop_timer = millis();
        analogValue = analogRead(photodiode);
        Serial.printlnf("AnalogValue == %u", analogValue);
    }
}
```

10. To monitor the Argon locally, run the command "particle serial monitor" from the command line interface.

11. Test your system by changing the lighting near the photodiode and monitoring the numeric light levels on the command line interface. A value near 0 would signal no light and a value of 1000 or so would mean the photodiode is near a light bulb.

12. We are reading the light values every 5 seconds and the values are available locally on the serial monitor. Next, we would like to transmit these values to the internet where Node-RED will be listening. We will use standard HTTP and JSON messages to do so.

13. Using the "Particle Libraries" icon (on the far left just above the question mark), search for and add the httpclient library and include it in the LightMonitor project. Your code should now include the C++ statement:
```
#include <HttpClient.h>

```
14. Copy the following code and paste it over the light monitor code in Question 9. It is almost the same code but we have added the logic to perform HTTP post requests with JSON data. The IP address of your machine needs to be included in this code. "Localhost" will not work. "Localhost" would refer to the Argon's IP address.

```
// This #include statement was automatically added by the Particle IDE.
#include <HttpClient.h>

// File name: ArgonSimpleLightMonitor
// View output from the command line with
// particle serial monitor

 // Define the http variable to be of type HttpClient.
 HttpClient http;

 // We always pass Http headers on each request to the Http Server
 // Here, we only define a single header. The NULL, NULL pair is used
 // to terminate the list of headers.

 // The Content-Type header is used to inform the server
 // of the type of message that it will be receiving. Here,
 // we tell the server to expect to receive data marked up in
 // JSON.

 http_header_t headers[] = {
    { "Content-Type", "application/json" },
    { NULL, NULL }
 };

 // Here we define structures to hold the request and the response data.
 // These are declared with types defined in the header file included above.

 http_request_t request;
 http_response_t response;

 //A variable to hold the device unique ID
 String deviceID = "";

// We want to read A0
int photoResistor = A0;
int analogValue;

unsigned long loop_timer;


 void setup() {

   // Specify the speed with which we will talk to the serial interface.
   // The serial interface is associated with our shell or command line interface.

   Serial.begin(9600);

   // The IP address of the server running on our machine.
   // Do not use localhost. The microcontroller would attempt
   // to visit itself with localhost.
   request.ip = IPAddress(192,168,86,232);

   // Specify the port that our server is listening on.
   request.port = 1880;

   // get the unique id of this device as 24 hex characters
   deviceID = System.deviceID().c_str();

   // display the id to the command line interface
   Serial.println(deviceID);


   // initialize the loop_timer variable to the current time
   loop_timer = millis();

   Serial.println("Light monitor setup complete");
 }

 // Provided with a response, display it to the command line interface.
 void printResponse(http_response_t &response) {
   Serial.println("HTTP Response: ");
   Serial.println(response.status);
   Serial.println(response.body);
 }

 void doPostRequest() {

     // buf will hold the JSON string
     char json[1000] = {0};

    // This class makes handling JSON data easy.
    // Associate it with the buf array of char.
    JSONBufferWriter writer(json, sizeof(json)-1);

    Serial.println("About to post");
   // Provide the path to the service
   // The HTTP IN node in Node-RED needs
   // is configured with a URL of microcontrollerLightValue
   request.path = "/microcontrollerLightValue";

   // convert the integer analogValue to a string
   std::string analogValueString = std::to_string(analogValue);
   char const *analogValueStr = analogValueString.c_str();  

   // build a JSON string
   writer.beginObject();
   writer.name("deviceID").value(deviceID);
   writer.name("lightReading").value(analogValueStr);
   writer.endObject();

   // for debugging, view the JSON on the CLI
   Serial.println("JSON String");
   Serial.println(json);
   // assign the JSON string to the HTTP request body
   request.body = json;
   // post the request
   http.post(request, response, headers);
   // show response
   printResponse(response);

   // clear the buffer holding the JSON request
   writer.buffer()[std::min(writer.bufferSize(), writer.dataSize())] = 0;
 }

void loop() {
    // every 5 seconds send an http post request
    if(millis() - loop_timer >= 5000UL) {
        loop_timer = millis();
        // read the light value from the photodiode
        analogValue = analogRead(photoResistor);
        Serial.printlnf("AnalogValue == %u", analogValue);
        doPostRequest();
    }
}
```
15. To check this solution, get Node-RED running and receiving these requests. You will need to create three nodes: an "HTTP IN" node, an "HTTP Response" node, and a "debug" node to view the messages that arrive from the Argon. Be sure to have this working before moving on.

16. Add a function node in between the "HTTP IN" node and the "debug" node. This function node will add a timestamp to messages going through. Since the microcontroller has specified that the messages are "application/json", Node-RED passes a Javascript object in the msg.payload. In other words, Node-RED has already parsed the incoming string and created a Javascript object. In order to complete this function, you will need to review the Javascript code on Project 1 Part 2. But keep in mind that a Javascript object is already available. Name this node "Add Timestamp".

17. Deploy your flow and check if your debug node is generating text such as this:

```
"{"deviceID":"e00fce68dfb40ca61243495e","lightReading":"89","time":"2021-06-05T21:00:09.832Z"}"
```
:checkered_flag: Take a screenshot showing the Node-RED flow and the debug window showing JSON strings. Name your screenshot Project2Part2.png.


### Part 3. Publishing Light Levels to MQTT

1. Add an "MQTT OUT" node to the Node-RED palette. Configure the new node to publish to the topic "argonLightLevel". The quality of service (QoS) is 0 and Mosquitto's port is 1883 running on localhost. The name of this Node is "To MQTT".

2. Connect your "HTTP IN" node to the "Add Timestamp" node. Connect the "Add Timestamp" node to the "To MQTT" node. Run mosquitto and deploy the flow. You should see events being published to mosquitto every 5 seconds or so.

:checkered_flag: Take a screenshot showing the Node-RED flow and the MQTT window as it receives visits. Name your screenshot Project2Part3.png.

:checkered_flag: Create a text file with the Javascript code that is inside your timestamp function node. Name this file Project2Part3.js.

### Part 4. Several browsers subscribe to microcontroller light levels

1. Write a web application using Node.js that includes Javascript that subscribes to the topic "argonLightLevel". The Javascript will be included in an HTML file and the browser display will show the changing values as they are reported from the Argon.

2. When the HTML runs in the browser, ask the user to provide a client side name. This name will be used to provide the client with a unique identifier as it connects to MQTT. If we do not change the name for each client, MQTT will assume that separate visits are all from the same client and will only respond to the last visitor. In other words, we would only be able to subscribe from one browser instance. We want to have several simultaneous visitors. How you design this input request is in your hands. You will need to work a bit with the HTML and Javascript.

:checkered_flag: Take a screenshot showing more than one browser receiving the same data from the broker. Name your screenshot Project2Part4.png.

:checkered_flag: Create a text file with the HTML and Javascript  code that is inside your index.html file. Name this file Project2Part4.html.

### Part 5. Subscribe to MQTT and visualize with Google Charts

1) [Spend some time reviewing Google Charts.](https://developers.google.com/chart) In particular, we are interested in the Gauge Chart.

2) Write a web application using Node.js. The web application will deliver HTML and Javascript to the browser and the the browser will subscribe to the MQTT "argonLightLevel" topic. Use Google Charts to visualize the data with a gauge chart. Several browser should be able to visit at the same time and view the same gauge.

![Two browsers subscribe with different ID's.](https://github.com/mm6/InternetOfThingsCourse/blob/master/images/TwoBrowsersSubscribe.png?raw=true)

These two browsers are each subscribing with a different client ID.

3) Add an additional Google Chart to the same web page. This would be any chart that you select (other than Gauge).

:checkered_flag: Take a screenshot showing the visualization. Name your screenshot Project2Part5.png.

:checkered_flag: Create a text file with the HTML and Javascript  code that is inside your index.html file. Name this file Project2Part5.html.

### Optional notes on Using a remote (rather than local) MQTT broker

If you are unable to install Mosquito on your local machine, I have had success with the following broker on the cloud:

broker.hivemq.com  for MQTT use port  1883
and for Websockets use port  8000

In my Javascript, I am using a line like this:
```

 var loc = {'hostname' : 'broker.hivemq.com', 'port' : '8000' };
```
When programming in Java, I would use a line like this:

```
String broker  = "tcp://broker.hivemq.com:1883";
```

Mosquito is fussy about the client ID. In the following line of code, I have used my Andrew ID.

```
client = new Paho.MQTT.Client(loc.hostname, Number(loc.port), 'mm6');
```

### Optional notes on Installing Mosquito on a Windows machine


Download mosquitto setup file from [here.](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/mosquitto/binary/win32/mosquitto-1.4.10-install-win32.exe)

Run the setup file and follow the steps to complete the installation.
note: Default destination folder is C:\Program Files (x86)\mosquitto

Download and Install Win32 OpenSSL v1.0.2h [from here.](http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)

Install it to C:\temp\OpenSSL-Win32.
