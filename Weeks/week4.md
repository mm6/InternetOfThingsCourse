# Carnegie Mellon University

# 95-733 Internet of Things Week 4

## Topics

During week 4, we go into detail on the MQTT protocol, client side technologies such as micro controllers, personal area networks, programmable logic controllers, and SCADA systems. We also discuss Bluetooth
and Bluetooth LE. We end the week by comparing BLE with XMPP. The comparison is of interest because
BLE's focus is on short distance, resource constrained, networking. XMPP, on the other hand, works
on the internet at large. Both protocols utilize service discovery.
