# 95-733 Internet of Things Week 2

## Topics

In week 2 we consider how the design of the World Wide Web provides guidance on the construction of the internet of things.

We look at four interaction patterns provided by HTTP and study some important details associated with server side AJAX.

Security and privacy are continuing concerns.

We argue that, with the adoption of web standards, an interoperable internet of things is possible.

The Particle IDE is introduced and over the air updates are described and shown. Micro controller to Node-RED is demonstrated.
Javascript is used to program individual nodes.
